        Before man came to blow it right <br>
       The wind once blew itself untaught, <br>
       And did its loudest day and night <br>
       In any rough place where it caught. <br>
      </p>

      <p>
        Man came to tell it what was wrong: <br>
       It hadn’t found the place to blow; <br>
       It blew too hard—the aim was song.<br>
       And listen—how it ought to go!<br>
      </p>

      <p>
        He took a little in his mouth,<br>
       And held it long enough for north<br>
       To be converted into south,<br>
       And then by measure blew it forth.<br>
      </p>

      <p>
        By measure. It was word and note,<br>
       The wind the wind had meant to be—<br>
       A little through the lips and throat.<br>
       The aim was song—the wind could see.<br>

          The first story I ever write<br>
          is a bright crayon picture<br>
          of a dancing tree, the branches<br>
          tossed by island wind.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
          I draw myself standing beside the tree,<br>
          with a colorful parrot soaring above me,<br>
          and a magical turtle clasped in my hand,<br>
          and two yellow wings fluttering<br>
          on the proud shoulders of my ruffled<br>
          Cuban rumba dancer's<br>
          fancy dress.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
          In my California kindergarten class,<br>
          the teacher scolds me: REAL TREES<br>
          DON'T LOOK LIKE THAT.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
          It's the moment<br>
          when I first<br>
          begin to learn<br>
          that teachers<br>
          can be wrong.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
          They have never seen<br>
          the dancing plants<br>
          of Cuba.<br>
